Tables

- Two tables A & B are joined by comma to yield all combos of rows from A & rows from B

# Sample table with dog and fur type
create table dogs as
    select "abraham" as name, "long" as fur union
    select "barack", "short" union
    select "clinton", "long";

# Table with the dog's parent and the child
create table parents as
    select "abraham" as parent, "barack" as child union
    select "abraham", "clinton";

Task: select parents of curly furred dogs
select parent from parents, dogs
  where child = name and fur = "curly";

select * from parents, dogs
  where child = name

- Things get murkier is two tables share the same column name
  - Deal with this problem using dot expressions and aliases


select [columns] from [table] where [condition] order by [order]

Task: select all pairs of siblings

select a.child as first, b.child as second
  from parents as a, parents as b
    where a.parent = b.parent and a.child < b.child

- (parents as a) --> gives parents table an alias
- Dot expressions allows you to reference which table you're getting data from


Numerical expressions in SQL are similar to those in Python
- Use the normal numerical operations
- abs, round, not
- Compare values: <, <=, >, =, !=, <>

* Given: a table cities with latitude, longitude, and name *

# Table that uses the comparison operators
create table north as
  select name from cities where latitude >= 43

# Table that utilizes arithmetic
create table distances as
  select a.name as first, b.name as second
    60 * (b.latitude - a.latitude) as distance
    from cities as a, cities as b


SQL also can deal with string expressions
- String values can be combined to form larger strings
select "hello, " || "world"; --> hello, world

create table phrase as select "hello, world" as s;
select substr(s, 4, 2) || substr(s, instr(s, " ")+1, 1) from phrase
- First component selects a substring from s starting at 4 that's 2 characters long
- Second component selects a substring from s that starts from the place right after
the location of the first space of length 1 from phrase
- || operator concactenates the two substrings together
