Exceptions
- Built in mechanism in a programming language to declare and respond to exceptional conditions
- Python automatically raises an exception if an error occurs
- Exceptions can be handled by a programming
- Sometimes it's helpful to be able build a program to deal with Exceptions
    - Exceptions should be treated as objects--have classes w/ constructors
    - Enable non-local continuation of control
        - Continue processing in another frame
- assert <expression>, <string>
    - Assertions are supposed to be used whenever you want, essentially
    - You can turn them on or off for efficiency
- TypeError-Func tion passed wrong type of argument/type of argument
- NameError-Name not found
- KeyError-Key isn't in a dictionary


Try statements handle Exceptions
- <try suite> is executed first
- If there's an error, an exception is raised that is not handled
- If the class of the exception inherits from <exception class>
    - The <except suite> is executed, with <name> bound to the execution


try:
    <try suite>
except <exception class> as <name>:
    <except suite>
